Stopwatch

In this task, I used HTML, CSS and Javascript,  to create a stopwatch with the following functions:
1. Start the timer -  When the user clicks the 'start; button, the timer starts running.
2. Stop the timer -  When the user clicks the 'stop' button, the timer pauses.
3. Resume the timer - When the user clicks the 'stop' button, the timer pauses the start button test changes to 'Resume'. When clicked, the timer resumes its running.
4. Lap - This enables the user to record all the laps and their specific time of the lap.
5. Reset timer - When the user clicks the 'reset' button, all the timer events stop, the timer is set back to '00:00:00' and the lap record is cleared.
